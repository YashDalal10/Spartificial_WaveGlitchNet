# WaveGlitchNet - 

Convolutional Neural Network model that classifies glitches / noise in detected Gravitational Wave Data.

## Abstract - 

Gravitational wave (GW) detectors are crucial to the observation of cosmic phenomena, but at the same time they suffer from transient noise artifacts labeled as "glitches". These are disturbing factors when trying to discern bona fide gravitational waves and classify them correctly, which in turn is fundamental for improving the trustworthiness of GW detections. This project deals with the design and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for gravitational wave glitch classification, in order to provide increased accuracy compared to legacy processing pipelines. The architecture of the CNN is designed to learn more intricate patterns that are present in the glitched data (preprocessed from labelled datasets provided by LIGO). The process of training and optimization is lengthy, encompassing the adjustment of hyperparameter tuners as well as performing evaluation across manifold architectures. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in classification accuracy, with the CNN model effectively distinguishing between different types of glitches. This advancement in glitch classification not only contributes to the reduction of false positives in GW detection but also underscores the potential of deep learning techniques in enhancing the sensitivity and precision of future gravitational wave research.
